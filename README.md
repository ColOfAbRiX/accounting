# Accounting Service

Service to manage home accounting with data import from different formats, single transaction
management and extensive statistics. A future project is to add machine learning to automatically
categorize the transactions.

The target of the project is to learn pure FP programming and distributed architectures.

The project make use of the following technologies and libraries:

* [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org)
* [SBT multi-projects](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/)
* [Shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless)
* [Enumeratum](https://github.com/lloydmeta/enumeratum)
* [Refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined)
* [FS2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2)
* [Logback and log4s](https://github.com/Log4s/log4s)
* [Chimney](https://scalalandio.github.io/chimney/)
* [PureConfig](https://pureconfig.github.io/)
* [Kantan Csv](https://nrinaudo.github.io/kantan.csv/)
* [Http4s](https://http4s.org/)
* [Tapir](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir)
* [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/)

I used fully functional programming style and best practices enforced via Wartremover and strict compiler settings.

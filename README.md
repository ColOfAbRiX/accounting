management and extensive statistics. A future project is to add machine learning to automatically
categorize the transactions.

The application a microservice architecture developed using SBT multi-project, Scala 2.13, Http4s,
Cats, FS2, Tapir and Shapeless. I used fully functional programming style and best practices
enforced via Wartremover and strict compiler settings.
